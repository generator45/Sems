(()) can be ued for doing C like operations in bash

eg.==>  
	if(($age<30)) similar to if[$age -lt 30]


2)OWNERS && GROUPS
-- fileType permisssions
--     		

3) seq command for loop

1. Block Special Files (Block Devices)
These represent hardware devices that transfer data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 512 bytes, 4KB).
Used for storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and CD-ROMs.
The kernel buffers and optimizes access to these devices for efficiency.
Example: /dev/sda (a hard drive), /dev/mmcblk0 (an SD card).
Characteristics of Block Devices
Supports random access (you can read/write at any location).
Data transfer occurs in blocks.
Examples of block device commands:
sh
Copy
Edit
ls -l /dev | grep "^b"   # List all block devices
sudo fdisk -l            # View partition details of block devices
2. Character Special Files (Character Devices)
These represent devices that transmit data one character at a time.
Used for serial communication devices, keyboards, mice, and terminals.
No buffering or block optimization is performed by the kernel.
Example: /dev/ttyS0 (a serial port), /dev/random (random number generator).
Characteristics of Character Devices
Sequential access only (cannot seek to a specific location like block devices).
Data is transferred byte-by-byte.
Examples of character device commands:
sh
Copy
Edit
ls -l /dev | grep "^c"   # List all character devices
cat /dev/random          # Print random bytes (interrupt with Ctrl+C)

--------------------------------------------------------------
The main difference between block and character devices is how they handle data transfer:

Block Devices → Transfer data in blocks (fixed-size chunks), allowing random access (you can jump to any part of the data).

Example: Hard drives (/dev/sda), SSDs, USB drives.
Use case: Storing files, partitions, databases.
Character Devices → Transfer data one character (byte) at a time, using sequential access (you have to read/write in order, no jumping around).

Example: Keyboards (/dev/input/), serial ports (/dev/ttyS0), printers.
Use case: Direct interaction with hardware (input/output).
Think of it like this:

Block devices are like a book 📖—you can open any page directly.
Character devices are like an audiobook 🎧—you must listen in order, no skipping ahead instantly.

Key Differences Between Hard Links and Soft Links

Feature	Hard Link	Soft Link
Type	Duplicate reference to the same file	Shortcut (pointer) to a file
Inode	Same as original	Different from original
Works if original is deleted?	✅ Yes	❌ No (broken link)
Can link directories?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Can cross filesystems?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Storage	Same as original file	Stores only the file path
